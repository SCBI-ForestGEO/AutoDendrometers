This folder contains the data files necessary to construct a full record for each dendrometer. 
The presence of more than one file for a dendrometer indicates that its data are spread over more than one file. 
This occurs when data are downloaded starting at a flag created at the time of a previous download.
(The instruments retain the full data record, but downloading just from a flag saves time/ laptop power in the field.) 
Tentatively, we are following the protocol that flags are created in the late winter/early spring prior to the commencement of growth.
