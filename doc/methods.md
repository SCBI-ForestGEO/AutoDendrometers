Tomst point dendrometers : https://tomst.com/web/en/systems/tms/point-dendrometer/

## Initial Installation (n=8 dendrometers)
On March 2, 2022, we installed dendrometers on four species (LITU, QURU, CAGL, FAGR) in each of two size/ canopy positions (large canopy dominants, small sub-canopy trees). List of trees is [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/AutoDendrometers/blob/main/data/PointDendrometerTrees.csv).

### Species
Species included most productive species in each of the genera that contributed most to whole-plot productivity from 2013-2018, 2 diffuse-porous and 2 ring-porous:

- *Liriodendron tulipifera* (1st in ANPP, diffuse-porous, shade-intolerant)
- *Quercus rubra* (2nd in ANPP, ring-porous, intermediate shade tolerance)
- *Fagus grandifolia* (8th in ANPP, diffuse-porous, shade-tolerant) 
- *Carya glabra* (5th in ANPP - most productive Carya, ring-porous, intermediate shade tolerance) 

### Sizes / canopy positions
Each species has a representative in each of the following crown positions:
- canopy dominant (â‰¥60 cm DBH, crown.illum = 3 or 4)
- understory (<30 cm DBH, crown.illum = 1 or 2 )

### Additional criteria
- long-term dendroband record (biweekly strongly preferred, but biannual for large CAGL because we had no biweekly dendrometer band records for large CAGLs)
- existing tree-ring record preferred
- Tree was healthy, with no notable damage in the 2021 mortality census and growth of >2 mm circumference in 2021 (according to dendrometer band measurements).

### Installation methods
- dendrometers installed on N side of tree
- installed near breast height, >2cm but <10 cm from existing dendrometer bands, avoiding placement that would conflict with reading dendrometer bands or measuring DBH
- removed outer bark, placing dendrometers on outer edge of living tissue
- readings set for every 15 min
