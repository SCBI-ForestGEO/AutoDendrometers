## Tree selection
### Species

12 species, including all species with tree-ring chronologies except for FRAM and FRNI (which are dying), or 12 of the top 14 species in terms of ANPP_woody from 2013-2018, excepting FRAM (dying) and ACRU (13th place).

- LITU
- QURU
- QUVE
- QUAL
- CAGL
- QUPR
- FAGR
- JUNI
- CATO
- CACO
- CAOVL
- PIST

### Sizes / canopy positions
Each species has a representative in each of the following crown positions:

- canopy dominant: â‰¥30 cm DBH, crown.illum = 3 or 4
- understory: <30 cm DBH (with one exception: 46-cm DBH QUAL), crown.illum = 1 or 2 

### Additional criteria
- long-term dendroband record (biweekly strongly preferred) if possible. If no trees of appropriate size/canopy position were available, dendrometer bands were added at time of install.
- existing tree-ring record preferred
- Tree was relatively healthy (most recent mortality census classified as A or AU with only minor damage and strong growth) and growth of >2 mm circumference in the past year (according to dendrometer band measurements, when available).

## Installations
### Batch 1 (n=8 dendrometers)
On March 2, 2022, we installed dendrometers on four species (LITU, QURU, CAGL, FAGR) in each of two size/ canopy positions (large canopy dominants, small sub-canopy trees). List of trees is [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/AutoDendrometers/blob/main/data/PointDendrometerTrees.csv).

Species included most productive species in each of the genera that contributed most to whole-plot productivity from 2013-2018, 2 diffuse-porous and 2 ring-porous:

- *Liriodendron tulipifera* (1st in ANPP, diffuse-porous, shade-intolerant)
- *Quercus rubra* (2nd in ANPP, ring-porous, intermediate shade tolerance)
- *Fagus grandifolia* (8th in ANPP, diffuse-porous, shade-tolerant) 
- *Carya glabra* (5th in ANPP - most productive Carya, ring-porous, intermediate shade tolerance) 

### Batch 2 (n=14 dendrometers)
Between June 23 and July 7, 2022, we installed dendrometers on an additional 8 species (CACO, CAOVL, CATO, JUNI, PIST, QUAL, QUPR, QUVE). This gave us all species with tree-ring chronologies except for FRAM and FRNI (which are dying), and 12 of the top 14 species in terms of ANPP_woody from 2013-2018, excepting FRAM (dying) and ACRU (13th place). 
We followed the same design as in the first batch : targeting two size/ canopy positions (large canopy dominants, small sub-canopy trees). We did not identify understory JUNI or QUVE at this time, as there were not appropriate trees with dendrometer bands. These were identified and installed later, with batch 3.

### Batch 3 (n=14 dendrometers)
Between February 23 and 28, 2023, we installed one more dendrometer on canopy trees of each of the 12 species, plus understory JUNI and QUVE (completing design of batch 2)

## Installation methods
- dendrometers installed on N side of tree
- installed near breast height, >2cm but <10 cm from existing dendrometer bands, avoiding placement that would conflict with reading dendrometer bands or measuring DBH
- removed outer bark (except for FAGR), placing dendrometers on outer edge of living tissue
- readings set for every 15 min
